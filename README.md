# Suman Shop (fixed - minimal)

I inspected and applied minimal fixes so the app no longer fails immediately due to placeholder `...` lines and missing Supabase env variables.

## What I changed (summary)
- Replaced three admin components with simplified, syntactically-correct versions:
  - `components/admin-guard.tsx`
  - `components/admin-header.tsx`
  - `components/admin-nav.tsx`
- Made Supabase client/server helpers tolerant and added clearer warnings/errors:
  - `lib/supabase/client.ts`
  - `lib/supabase/server.ts`
- Added `.env.example` with required Supabase environment variables and instructions.
- Added this README explaining next steps.

## Why the admin panel was failing
- Several component files contained literal `...` lines which cause syntax errors and prevent the app from building.
- The project expects Supabase keys in environment variables. Without these, auth and admin features won't work.

## How to get the admin panel working fully (next steps you must do)
1. Create a Supabase project at https://app.supabase.com/
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` in the project root and paste your `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`.
3. (Optional) Run the SQL scripts included in `scripts/` folder to create initial tables and an admin user (look for `005_create_admin_user.sql`).
4. Install dependencies and run the app locally:
   - `pnpm install` (or `npm install`)
   - `pnpm dev` (or `npm run dev`)
5. Open `http://localhost:3000/admin` — the guard will redirect to `/auth/login` if you are not signed in.

If you want, I can also:
- Wire up the admin guard to check a user's role (admin) from the database.
- Restore the original, full admin UI components — but that requires reconstructing UI code that was truncated.
